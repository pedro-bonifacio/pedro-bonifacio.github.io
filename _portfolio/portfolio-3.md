## Overview

AutoMentor is an intelligent chatbot application designed to assist users in finding car listings, appraising vehicle values, and performing database similarity searches on car data. The app is built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and integrates machine learning to provide users with accurate automotive information.

## Features

1. **Car Listing Search**: Search listings from the Standvirtual database based on user chat input, making it easy to locate specific vehicles.
  
2. **Vehicle Appraisal**: Using the UMAP and Nearest Neighbors algorithms, AutoMentor finds comparable listings to provide an appraisal value.

3. **Vectorstore Similarity Search**: Find related data across different car brands with a similarity search powered by vectorstore.
